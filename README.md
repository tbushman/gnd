# gnd 
App for gathering signatures in support of government documents

Importantly, to run locally, include the String .env variable, `DEVPD` . It is the absolute path to the directory where you want to save the signatures generated by the app. 
The sample.env file has some info.  
Run a `mongod` process and adjust the `DEVDB` and `STORE` mongourls to your local authentication schema.
